# Project – Requirements

The requirements document is a complete description of the system from the point of view of the client. The
client may or may not be the end user. It lays out the entire logical structure of the system, defines all data items
that the user will ever see, describes the functioning of the system in detail, includes sample screen designs and
reports, and provides other information necessary for the client to approve the system and for the software
engineer to move on to the design.

**Issues to address** (Suggested page numbers assume document is word-processed, double-spaced, 11 or 12 point
font, and that margins are about one inch.)

* (5 pts.) Purpose of the system, scope. (1/2 page)
* (5 pts.) User population(s), including skill-levels in computing and in the application domain. (1/2 page)
* (5 pts.) High-level description of the computing environment anticipated, including external systems with
which the proposed system will have to interface. (1-2 paragraphs)
* (5 pts.) Important data and terms. (Dictionary or glossary, 1-3 pages)
* (10 pts.) Use case diagram.
* (10 pts.) Use case specification for each use case, including main flow of events and other details.
* (10 pts.) Functional requirements – specific requests on the user interface, initial ideas, layout, etc. (1-3 pages)
* (10 pts.) User documentation (manual and/or help files) giving all of the system functions visible to the user.
(1-3 pages)
* (10 pts.) User interface prototype(s). (Screen capture, 2 to 6 pages)
* (10 pts.) Non-functional requirements, such as performance, size, speed, security, usability, etc. (1/2 to 1 page)
* (5 pts.) Estimated size of the program (number of modules, lines of code). (1/2 page)
* (5 pts.) Validation of the requirements – a signed approval form from the client or an email from the client
detailing corrections to the document.

**Additional points**

* (5 pts.) Overall magnitude and complexity.
* (5 pts.) The requirements document should be submitted as a professional-looking report. Please include a
table of contents and proofread the report.
* (20 individual pts.) Include a section, which briefly describes each team member’s individual contribution in
this phase. This could be in the form of timesheets listing activities, date and time or more descriptive.
(Note: this information is requested only for course administration purposes. It is not part of a requirements
document.)
