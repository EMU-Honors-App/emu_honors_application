# Project Outline
This will be the first document you will be preparing for the semester-long project. The benefits of a project
outline are:
* Identification of the problem or need that will drive the project.
* A common understanding of the goal(s) of the project by the development team.
* A common understanding between the development team and the client, of the expectations of the project.
* A high-level understanding of the client’s requirements.
* A proposed solution to address the client’s need.
* Scope of the project.

You will meet with your client at least once before preparing the outline. Your first contact with the client should
include team-member introductions, purpose of the project as applicable to the course, and a request for a halfhour
meeting. This could be done via phone or email by the Project Lead. The meeting itself will be productive
if done in-person. Your meeting should focus on addressing the above points, which will later help you prepare
the report appropriately. Please do NOT send/give the above list to the client and ask him/her to answer them for
you. You should be able to extract the relevant information from your interview with the client. You will setup
one other meeting (probably an hour) in a week or two for the client to go over the detailed requirements with
you.

Please keep in mind that each member of the development team should meet the client at least once during one
of these initial meetings. The rest of the interactions with the client could be done in-person, via email or phone
throughout the semester, by a subgroup of students.

**Issues to address** (Suggested page numbers assume document is word-processed, double-spaced, 11 point font,
and that margins are about one inch.)
Based on your discussions with your client submit a short report (2-3 pages) which addresses the following.
* (5 pts.) Introduction to the client and their business.
* (10 pts.) Problem description – client’s software need.
* (5 pts.) Suggested solution – should be high-level and not include CS jargon.
* (5 pts.) Scope – what will be included in the project and what will not.

The following information is requested only for course administration purposes. It is typically not part of a
regular project outline.

* Plan – each team member’s anticipated role and contribution to the project.
* Special needs for the development team – user accounts, special software, etc.

**Additional points**

* (5 individual pts.) Include a section which briefly describes each team member’s individual contribution in
this phase. This could be in the form of timesheets listing activities, date and time or more descriptive.
